  summary: "## Summary\n
Hello there,
I hope you are doing great!,\n
I have found a Cross site scripting vulnerability in one of the [domain]({{host}}) mentioned in the scope.\n


An attacker can use Cross site scripting to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user.\nThe end user's browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted and will execute the script.
\nBecause it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.\n

Vulnerable host: {{host}}
\nVulnerable parameter: {{param}}
"
  steps: "## Steps to reproduce
\n1. Open {{host}}{{param}} and you will see a alert."

  impact: "## Impact
\nAn Adversary can carry out XSS attack and also can take the cookie of the Admin and login through Admin Account.
Also, an adversary can manage to login through any other users account with valid session cookies. "

  remediation: "## Mitigation
\nSanitize all the user inputs before executing them."

  end: "Best regards,
\n{{username}}
