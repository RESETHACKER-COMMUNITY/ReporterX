report:
  summary: "## Summary\n
A rate limiting algorithm is used to check if the user session (or IP address) has to be limited based on the information in the session cache.
\nIn case a client made too many requests within a given time frame, HTTP servers can respond with status code 429: Too Many Requests. (wikipedia)
\nI just realize that on the reset password page, the request has no rate limit which then can be used to loop through one request.\n

Vulnerable host: {{host}}\n
"
  steps: "## Steps to reproduce:
\n1. Go to {{host}} and intercept the request.
\n2. Send the request to intruder and repeat it 100 times with null payloads.
\nYou'll see that the server is accepting the requests even after 100 continuous requests.
"
  impact: "## Impact
\nTrouble to the users on the website because huge email bombing can be done by the attackers within seconds."

  remediation: "## Mitigation
\nUse CAPTCHA verification if many request sent."
